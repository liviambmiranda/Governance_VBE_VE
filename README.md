# Overview

This repository explores the **validation, testing, and simulation analysis of blockchain governance mechanisms** for inter-organisational collaboration in **Virtual Enterprises** and **Virtual Breeding Environments (VBEs)**. The projects are divided into two major components:

1. **Empirical Validation and Testing**  
2. **Simulation Analysis**

## (1) Empirical Validation and Testing of Blockchain Governance Mechanisms

This project focuses on an **analytical model based on statistical methods** to evaluate the reliability of constructs, perform hypothesis testing, and analyse common method bias in a survey instrument used to validate and test the blockchain governance mechanisms based on responses from academics and practitioners.

### Key Features:

- **Construct Reliability**:
  - The model calculates **Cronbach's alpha** and **inter-item correlations (Kendall's tau)**.
  - Includes tests for **sample normality**.
  - [Access the code here.](Empirical_Analysis/Construct_Reliability)

- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Research hypotheses are evaluated using the **Wilcoxon signed-rank test**.
  - [Access the code here.](Empirical_Analysis/Hypotheses)

- **Common Method Bias**:
  - Analyses definitions used in the questionnaire to identify potential bias.
  - Employs sentiment analysis techniques.
  - [Access the code here.](Empirical_Analysis/Sentiment_Analysis)

## (2) Simulation Analysis of Blockchain Governance Mechanisms

This project provides an **analytical model based on simulation** to study the **long-term feasibility of blockchain governance mechanisms**, focusing on firms' participation in shared decision-making based on voting.

### Key Features:

- **Operational Validity**:
  - A **parameter variability-sensitivity analysis** evaluates the model by varying firms' participation probabilities.
  - [Access the code here.](Simulation_Model/Validity)

- **Power Imbalance**:
  - Tracks the difference between the maximum and minimum token holdings among firms to measure inequality in voting power after each iteration.

- **Administrative Efficiency**:
  - Quantifies the number of voting iterations that meet the minimum quorum, representing the **system's rate of valid decisions** after iterations.

### Code:

- The full simulation model and analysis scripts can be found in [Simulation_Model](Simulation_Model).
